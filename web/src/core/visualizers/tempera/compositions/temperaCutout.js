// Shared plumbing for the three families that punch holes through the tone field. A hole is
// genuinely transparent - the Pixi canvas runs on `backgroundAlpha: 0` - so it shows the
// shell's live background layer, veiled only by the scene's paper wash (which is built per
// paragraph and cannot be cut per shot).
//
// One rule governs every cutout composition: **the lyric never sits over a hole.** The
// inversion filter reads the Pixi render target, and the DOM background lives outside WebGL,
// so over a hole the filter sees only the pale wash and picks ink - which then has to survive
// on top of whatever the background happens to be. Keep the type on solid tone; the hole is
// the picture, not the page.
