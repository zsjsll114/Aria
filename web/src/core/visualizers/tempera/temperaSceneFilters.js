// src/components/visualizer/tempera/temperaSceneFilters.ts
// Attaches the transition blur to a paragraph scene only while it is actually blurring.
//
// This is not a micro-optimisation, it is what keeps the lyric inversion correct. The
// difference filter on the text layer declares `blendRequired`, so Pixi copies the pixels
// already drawn beneath it into `uBackTexture` - and it takes the copy origin relative to the
// *enclosing* filter on the stack. A container filter that is attached but disabled is still
// pushed, as a skipped entry, and Pixi 8's `_getPreviousFilterData` hands that skipped entry
// back regardless (its loop stops at stack index 0 without rejecting it). The skipped entry
// never ran `_calculateFilterArea`, so its bounds are still `Infinity`; the copy origin
// underflows to 0,0 and every glyph is inverted against the top-left corner of the frame
// instead of the artwork underneath it.
//
// The scene-level post-process chain hid this: with post-process on, the enclosing entry is a
// real one with real bounds. With it off - the default - the only thing left on the scene
// container was the parked transition blur, which is exactly such a skipped entry. So the blur
// goes on for the length of the transition and comes off again; it is never parked disabled.

/**
 * The resolution every filter on the scene container runs at.
 *
 * Pixi's `Filter` default is a hard `resolution: 1`, and none of the shared sonnet passes
 * override it, so switching post-processing on used to rasterize the whole composition at one
 * device pixel per CSS pixel and stretch it back up to the canvas (`textureResolution`, 1.5 by
 * default). Fine hatch, the screentone lattice and the type all softened - the sharpest thing
 * in the mode paid for the grain. 'inherit' keeps the pass at the canvas resolution instead,
 * and the compression switch keeps the old downscale available for weak GPUs.
 *
 * This is safe for the lyric inversion, which is otherwise very sensitive to resolution: Pixi
 * takes the *minimum* resolution across the filters in one array, so a container's whole pass
 * lands on a single value; the difference filter one level down asks for `'inherit'`, which
 * resolves to the resolution of the surface it is rendering into - that same pass - and its
 * `uBackTexture` is copied from that same surface at that same resolution. Input and backdrop
 * therefore keep identical pooled (pow2) sizes and one `vTextureCoord` indexes both. The rule
 * to preserve: never give the text layer's own filter a fixed resolution, and never mix fixed
 * resolutions inside one array expecting them to survive - the minimum wins.
 *
 * `renderResolution` is what the canvas is actually running at - `textureResolution` after
 * `snapResolutionToTexturePool` - and not the setting. The two differ whenever the snap took a
 * step down, and a pass pinned to the setting would then be asking for a surface *larger* than
 * the one it is drawn onto, which is the waste the snap exists to remove.
