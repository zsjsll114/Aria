// src/utils/lyrics/wordSegmentation.ts
// The single word-granularity segmenter for lyrics. Before this file, sonnetSemantic.ts and
// temperaProgram.ts carried byte-for-byte identical `getSegmenterParts` helpers and
// cjkSemanticLayout.ts carried a third variant, so a user-supplied override would have had to be
// wired into three places that could drift apart.
//
// Callers that have a Line should use `segmentLyricWords`, which honours `line.wordSegments` (the
// user's saved segmentation, baked on upstream by createLyricsSetter). `segmentTextWords` is the
// no-override path for text that has no Line behind it.
// (接口 LyricWordSegment 已随 TypeScript 类型标注一并移除。)

 * Intl.Segmenter always emits a whitespace run as a segment in its own right, and every consumer is
 * written against that. tempera tells a real word gap from a bare CJK word boundary by the hole a
 * dropped whitespace segment leaves in the offsets, and cjkSemanticLayout skips whitespace segments
 * when aligning to parser words, which never contain any. The saved format is the other way round:
 * the prompt tells the model that a space belongs to the segment before it, and
 * realignSegmentsToText attaches the line's real whitespace to whichever slice sits next to it. So
 * an unsplit boundary arrives downstream as a word with a space glued on — which read as "no space
 * here" in tempera, and failed to align at all in cjkSemanticLayout.
 *
 * Whitespace INSIDE a segment is deliberately left alone. It is the one thing this format can say
 * that Intl.Segmenter cannot — a multi-word phrase the user kept together on purpose — and the
 * consumers already handle it (or already fall back) exactly as they do today. Punctuation is left
 * attached for the same reason: the sticky passes in tempera and sonnet would re-attach it anyway.
